# Feature Specification: Autonomous Lead Generation System with Agentic MCP Server

**Strategic Positioning:**
This system defines a new category: **Autonomous Business Development Infrastructure**. It is positioned as premium, business-critical infrastructure ($999-2000/month) that replaces full-time lead generation roles ($60k+/year). Unlike productivity tools, it enables "set it and forget it" operation‚Äîbusinesses configure rules once and Claude Code agents autonomously monitor, execute, and optimize lead generation 24/7, delivering continuous value and business intelligence without human intervention.

**Feature Branch**: `003-autonomous-lead-generation`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Autonomous lead generation system using Claude Code's agentic capabilities with SignalHire's API. The core idea is to transform SignalHire from a manual tool into a 'set it and forget it' business infrastructure that runs 24/7. Instead of users manually clicking through SignalHire's UI, Claude Code agents will continuously monitor business conditions, execute bulk searches, reveal contacts, and deliver results directly to CRM systems without human intervention. The architecture should be SignalHire API ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Claude Code Agent, where we create an MCP server that exposes SignalHire's search and reveal APIs as structured tools that agents can compose into complex autonomous workflows. For example, a recruitment agency could set rules like 'every Monday find 50 software engineers who changed jobs in the last 2 weeks, avoid anyone we've contacted, prioritize Series A-C companies, and create personalized outreach sequences' and Claude would execute this completely autonomously. The CLI we built should remain for local development and testing, but the MCP server becomes the production interface for agents. This isn't about making SignalHire faster - it's about creating autonomous business development infrastructure that replaces full-time lead generation roles and justifies premium pricing of $999-2000/month because it provides continuous value while teams sleep. The system should be self-optimizing, learning from performance data to improve search strategies over time, and provide business intelligence about market conditions and pipeline health. Can you help me design and implement the MCP server architecture that exposes SignalHire's APIs as agent-friendly tools, focusing on the core tools for searching prospects, revealing contacts, exporting results, and monitoring pipeline health that enable these autonomous workflows?"

## Technical Architecture Overview

**Architecture:**
SignalHire API ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Claude Code Agent

The MCP server exposes agent-optimized tools (not CLI commands) for structured, composable workflows. These tools include:
- `search_prospects()`
- `reveal_contacts()`
- `monitor_pipeline_health()`
- `analyze_market_conditions()`
- `score_and_enrich_leads()`
- `integrate_with_crm()`

Agents can compose these tools into complex, autonomous workflows that deliver not just contacts, but actionable business intelligence and self-optimizing strategies.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business (e.g., recruitment agency) configures autonomous lead generation rules (e.g., "find 50 software engineers who changed jobs in the last 2 weeks every Monday, avoid previously contacted, prioritize Series A-C companies, create personalized outreach"). The system runs 24/7, automatically searching, revealing, and exporting leads to the CRM, optimizing strategies over time, and providing business intelligence on pipeline health.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of lead generation rules, **When** the scheduled time arrives, **Then** the system autonomously executes searches, reveals contacts, and exports results to the CRM without human intervention.
2. **Given** a history of previously contacted leads, **When** a new search is performed, **Then** the system avoids including those leads in the results.
3. **Given** performance data over time, **When** the system detects underperforming search strategies, **Then** it adapts and optimizes future searches automatically.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when SignalHire API rate limits or errors occur? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error handling and retry policy]
- How does the system handle CRM integration failures? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Fallback and notification mechanism]
- What if no new leads match the criteria for a scheduled run?
- How does the system ensure data privacy and compliance? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention, deletion, and compliance requirements]

### Core UI Components
1. **Natural Language Chat Interface**
    - Users can configure workflows by describing requirements in plain English (e.g., "every Monday find 50 software engineers who changed jobs in the last 2 weeks, avoid anyone we've contacted, prioritize Series A-C companies, and create personalized outreach sequences").
    - System parses and translates these instructions into structured autonomous rules.
    - Supports follow-up questions, clarifications, and iterative refinement.
2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
    - Real-time status of all active, scheduled, and completed workflows.
    - Performance metrics: leads generated, conversion rates, time to contact, etc.
    - Business intelligence insights: market trends, pipeline health, actionable recommendations.
    - Controls to pause, modify, or override workflows as needed.
3. **Template Management**
    - Save, share, and reuse successful workflow patterns.
    - Organize templates by market segment, persona, or use case.
    - Version control and team sharing for templates.
4. **Enterprise Features**
    - Team management: invite users, assign roles, manage permissions.
    - Multi-market workflow coordination: manage workflows across multiple teams or business units.
    - Webhook and CRM integration configuration.
    - Audit logs: track all actions, changes, and system events for compliance.
    - Compliance reporting: generate reports for regulatory or internal review.

### Key Insights
- The UI must empower users to configure and control autonomous workflows through natural language, not just forms or settings.
- Monitoring and business intelligence are first-class features‚Äîusers need to see not just what the system is doing, but why, and what actions are recommended.
- Enterprise customers require robust team, permission, and compliance management.
- The UI should feel like a mission control center for business development, not a simple productivity tool.
