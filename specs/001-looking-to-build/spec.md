# Feature Specification: SignalHire Lead Generation Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-looking-to-build`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "looking to build an agent that logs into signalhire, puts in search terms, locations, can use the bulk reveal features, not sure if it can use the api directly to do all of this or we need to actually login to the system directly on page to do this once it gets all of the of emails it can export it to a csv file natively in from signalhire I do have access to signal api key and docs for you to look at if needed when we get into the planning phase"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**Phase 1 (CLI MVP)**: A business user needs to generate leads from SignalHire by specifying search criteria, revealing contact information using browser automation (1000+ capacity vs 100 API limit), and exporting results to CSV.

**Future Vision**: Sales teams and agencies need a comprehensive platform that automates lead generation across multiple platforms (SignalHire, LinkedIn, Apollo, ZoomInfo), provides team collaboration features, real-time dashboards, and white-label customization for enterprise clients. Market opportunity: $2B+ lead generation software market with no existing AI-powered multi-platform automation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
**Phase 1 (CLI MVP):**
1. **Given** the agent is configured with SignalHire credentials, **When** a user provides search terms and location filters, **Then** the system returns a list of matching prospects
2. **Given** a list of prospects has been found, **When** the user requests bulk reveal via browser automation, **Then** the system reveals 1000+ email addresses efficiently using AI-powered web interaction
3. **Given** contact information has been revealed, **When** the user requests export, **Then** the system generates a CSV file containing all prospect data
4. **Given** invalid or expired credentials, **When** the agent attempts to access SignalHire, **Then** the system provides clear error messaging and authentication guidance

**Future Scenarios:**
5. **Given** a sales team using the web platform, **When** they create a multi-platform search across SignalHire, LinkedIn, and Apollo, **Then** the system provides unified, deduplicated results with real-time progress tracking
6. **Given** an agency with white-label access, **When** they configure custom branding and client-specific workflows, **Then** the platform delivers branded lead generation services under their identity
7. **Given** enterprise users, **When** they integrate with Salesforce CRM, **Then** leads automatically sync with proper field mapping and validation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when search criteria return no results?
- How does the system handle SignalHire rate limits or bulk reveal quotas?
- What occurs when export fails due to insufficient permissions or system errors?
- How does the agent handle session timeouts during long-running operations?
