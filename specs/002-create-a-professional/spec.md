# Feature Specification: Refactor to API-Only SignalHire Agent

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-a-professional`  
**Created**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Refactor existing SignalHire lead generation agent to use pure API integration, removing browser automation dependencies while maintaining all current functionality. Focus on reliability within the 100 contacts per day API limit."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Refactoring request: Remove browser automation, keep API functionality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: existing users (sales professionals, recruiters)
   ‚Üí Actions: refactor, cleanup, maintain functionality
   ‚Üí Data: existing models (Prospect, ContactInfo, SearchCriteria)
   ‚Üí Constraints: 100/day API limit, backward compatibility
3. No unclear aspects - existing codebase provides full context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear refactoring flow: cleanup ‚Üí test ‚Üí maintain compatibility
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Focus on refactoring and cleanup tasks
6. Identify Key Entities: Leverage existing data models
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí Refactoring scope clearly defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the existing SignalHire agent codebase, I need to refactor the system to remove browser automation dependencies and focus on API-only operations, so that the system becomes more reliable, maintainable, and compliant with SignalHire's intended usage patterns while preserving all existing functionality for current users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the existing codebase with browser automation, **When** I refactor to API-only, **Then** all CLI commands continue to work identically but use only API services
2. **Given** existing data models and services, **When** I remove browser dependencies, **Then** the core functionality (search, reveal, export) remains unchanged
3. **Given** existing tests and contracts, **When** I complete the refactoring, **Then** all tests pass and API contracts are maintained  
4. **Given** existing configuration and workflows, **When** users upgrade, **Then** their workflows continue working without changes
5. **Given** the 100/day API limit, **When** operations are performed, **Then** clear quota tracking and warnings are provided

### Edge Cases
- What happens to existing browser automation code during cleanup?
- How are existing user configurations preserved during refactoring?
- What occurs when dependencies are removed but CLI interface remains the same?
- How is backward compatibility ensured for existing workflows?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all browser automation dependencies (Stagehand, Botasaurus, Playwright) from the codebase
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all existing CLI commands and their interfaces without breaking changes
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain all existing data models (Prospect, ContactInfo, SearchCriteria, Operations) without modification
- **FR-004**: System MUST continue to provide search functionality using only the existing SignalHire API client
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue to provide contact reveal functionality respecting the 100/day API limit
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain existing CSV export capabilities and format compatibility
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve existing configuration management and credential handling
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain existing error handling and logging functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST clean up package dependencies to remove unused browser automation libraries
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all existing contract tests continue to pass after refactoring
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain existing rate limiting and credit monitoring capabilities
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve all existing workflow commands and their functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST update documentation to reflect API-only approach
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for existing user configurations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Existing Data Models**: Preserve all current models (Prospect, ContactInfo, SearchCriteria, Experience, Education, Operations) without changes
- **API Client**: Leverage existing SignalHireClient for all operations
- **CLI Interface**: Maintain existing command structure and user experience  
- **Services**: Keep CSV export, rate limiting, and credit monitoring services
- **Configuration**: Preserve existing environment variable and configuration patterns

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]

- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
