# SignalHire UI Design Proposal

## 🎯 Overview

The current SignalHire CLI is powerful but not user-friendly for non-technical users. This document outlines options for creating a chat-like interface that uses Claude Code SDK integration to execute CLI commands in the background, providing a natural language interface for lead generation.

## 🚀 Recommended Approaches

### **Option 1: Claude Code SDK + Web Chat Interface**

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Frontend sends natural language requests
"Find 100 software engineers in San Francisco with Python experience"

// Claude Code SDK processes and executes CLI
await claudeCode.execute(`
python3 -m src.cli.main search 
  --title "Software Engineer" 
  --location "San Francisco" 
  --keywords "python" 
  --size 100
`)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Natural language → CLI commands
- ✅ Real-time progress updates  
- ✅ Claude handles complex Boolean queries
- ✅ Chat history and saved searches
- ✅ Best user experience for non-technical users

### **Option 2: Streamlit Dashboard**

```python
# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st
import subprocess

st.title("SignalHire Lead Generation")

# Simple form inputs
title = st.text_input("Job Title", "Software Engineer")
location = st.text_input("Location", "San Francisco")
keywords = st.text_input("Skills/Keywords", "python, react")

if st.button("Search Prospects"):
    # Execute CLI in background
    result = subprocess.run([
        "python3", "-m", "src.cli.main", "search",
        "--title", title,
        "--location", location, 
        "--keywords", keywords
    ])
    st.success(f"Found {result} prospects!")
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Quick to implement (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Good for internal/power users
- ✅ Form-based interface familiar to users
- ✅ Built-in data visualization

### **Option 3: FastAPI + React Chat UI**

```javascript
// Chat component
const ChatInterface = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  
  const handleSearch = async (userMessage) => {
    // Send to FastAPI backend
    const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage })
    });
    
    // FastAPI processes with Claude and executes CLI
    const result = await response.json();
    setMessages([...messages, result]);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="chat-interface">
      {messages.map(msg => <ChatBubble {...msg} />)}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Most flexible and customizable
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Scalable architecture
- ✅ Can integrate advanced features

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Project Structure**
```bash
# Add to existing project
pip install fastapi streamlit websockets claude-code-sdk

# New structure:
src/
├── cli/              # Existing CLI (unchanged)
├── ui/
│   ├── chat_api.py   # FastAPI backend
│   ├── streamlit_app.py # Simple UI option
│   ├── static/       # React components
│   └── templates/    # HTML templates
docs/
├── ui/
│   ├── user_guide.md
│   └── screenshots/
```

### **Phase 2: Claude Code SDK Integration**

```python
# src/ui/chat_api.py
from claude_code_sdk import ClaudeCode
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
import subprocess
import json

class SignalHireChatBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude = ClaudeCode()
        
    async def process_request(self, user_message: str):
        # Claude interprets natural language
        plan = await self.claude.plan(f"""
        User request: {user_message}
        
        Available SignalHire CLI commands:
        - search: Find prospects by title, location, keywords
        - reveal: Get contact information for prospects  
        - export: Save results in various formats
        - status: Check credits and operation status
        
        Convert this request into the appropriate CLI command.
        Explain what you're doing and suggest next steps.
        """)
        
        # Execute CLI command
        result = await self.claude.execute(plan.command)
        
        return {
            "user_message": user_message,
            "claude_response": plan.explanation,
            "command_executed": plan.command,
            "results": result,
            "next_steps": plan.suggestions,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/api/chat")
async def chat_endpoint(request: ChatRequest):
    bot = SignalHireChatBot()
    response = await bot.process_request(request.message)
    return response

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    # Real-time progress updates during long operations
```

### **Phase 3: User Experience Features**

"Get contacts for the first 50 results"  
↓
Claude: "I'll reveal contact information for the first 50 prospects from your search"
↓
CLI: python3 -m src.cli.main reveal bulk --search-file results.json --size 50

"Export to Excel with company names and emails"
↓
Claude: "I'll export your results to Excel format with names, emails, and companies"
↓  
CLI: python3 -m src.cli.main export --format xlsx --columns "full_name,email_work,current_company"
```
