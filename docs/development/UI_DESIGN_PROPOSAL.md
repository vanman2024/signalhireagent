## 🚀 Simplified Technical Implementation

### **Minimal Viable Product Approach:**

```python
# src/ui/simple_api.py - No complex SDKs needed
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
import subprocess
import asyncio
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic

app = FastAPI(title="SignalHire AI Interface")
anthropic = AsyncAnthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

@app.post("/api/process")
async def process_natural_language(request: str):
    # Step 1: Claude interprets natural language
    claude_response = await anthropic.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""
            Convert this request to SignalHire CLI commands:
            "{request}"
            
            Available commands:
            - search --title "X" --location "Y" --keywords "Z" --size N
            - reveal bulk --search-file results.json --output contacts.csv
            - export --format csv --columns "name,email,company"
            
            Return just the CLI command, nothing else.
            """
        }]
    )
    
    # Step 2: Execute CLI command directly
    cmd_args = claude_response.content[0].text.split()
    result = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
        "python3", "-m", "src.cli.main", *cmd_args,
        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
    )
    
    stdout, stderr = await result.communicate()
    
    return {
        "original_request": request,
        "cli_command": " ".join(cmd_args), 
        "results": stdout.decode(),
        "status": "success" if result.returncode == 0 else "error"
    }
```

**Why This Approach Works:**
- ✅ **Leverages existing CLI**: No need to rewrite bulk processing logic
- ✅ **Simple deployment**: Just FastAPI + Claude API calls
- ✅ **Cost effective**: Pay per actual usage, not SDK licensing
- ✅ **Proven scalability**: CLI already handles 1000+ contacts efficiently
