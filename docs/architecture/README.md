# Architecture Documentation

System design, coordination frameworks, and API specifications.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Innovation: @Symbol Coordination
- **[AI_COORDINATION_PLAN.md](./AI_COORDINATION_PLAN.md)** - Revolutionary multi-agent coordination system
  - Breakthrough approach using @mention syntax in markdown
  - Scales from 2 agents to 20+ agents seamlessly
  - Self-organizing, tool-agnostic, zero-infrastructure

### Technical Specifications
- **[api.md](./api.md)** - API documentation and endpoint specifications
  - SignalHire integration patterns
  - Callback server architecture
  - Data models and validation

## üéØ Key Architectural Decisions

### Multi-Agent Coordination
The @symbol system represents a paradigm shift from complex orchestration to simple, universal patterns:

```markdown
# Traditional approach: Complex dependency graphs
# @symbol approach: Simple, clear ownership
- [ ] T051 @claude Browser integration {blocks: T052, T053}
- [ ] T052 @gemini Performance analysis {after: T051}  
- [ ] T060 @qwen Algorithm optimization {depends: T051}
```

### Agent Ecosystem Design
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has clear domain expertise
- **Cost Optimization**: Mix of premium (@claude, @copilot) and free (@qwen, @deepseek) agents
- **Scalable Assignment**: Add new agents by simply using @newagent syntax

## üí° Breakthrough Impact

This architecture pioneered:
1. **Self-Organizing Teams** - Agents coordinate through clear ownership
2. **Living Documentation** - Context stays current automatically
3. **Universal Coordination** - Works across any tools, platforms, or agents
4. **Scalable Collaboration** - Proven from small to massive projects

The @symbol coordination system could become the standard for AI agent collaboration.
