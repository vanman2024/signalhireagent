# Planning Directory

Future strategy documents, roadmaps, and potential directions for the SignalHire Agent project.

## Purpose

This directory contains:
- **Strategy documents** - High-level approaches and methodologies under consideration
- **Roadmap planning** - Future feature and development direction
- **Research notes** - Explorations of potential improvements or expansions
- **Scaling strategies** - Plans for handling larger workloads or user bases

## Current Documents

- `SCALE_TRACKING_STRATEGY.md` - Strategy for handling large-scale prospect tracking and management (SQLite approach - outdated, now using Airtable)
- `FUTURE_ECOSYSTEM.md` - Future ML/AI integration between SignalHire Agent and RedAI Platform for training data pipeline

## Guidelines

### What Goes Here:
✅ Future planning documents  
✅ Strategy explorations not yet implemented  
✅ Research into potential directions  
✅ Scaling and performance planning  
✅ Architecture evolution ideas  

### What Doesn't Go Here:
❌ Current implementation documentation (→ `developer/`)  
❌ User-facing guides (→ `user/`)  
❌ Active development specs (→ `specs/`)  
❌ Completed feature documentation (→ `developer/`)  

## Usage

These documents are:
- **Informational** - Not binding implementation requirements
- **Exploratory** - May or may not be implemented
- **Strategic** - Help guide long-term project direction
- **Reference** - Useful when considering future enhancements

When a strategy document becomes active development, move relevant parts to appropriate `specs/` or `developer/` locations.
