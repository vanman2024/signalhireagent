## CLI Commands for AI Assistance

**üìñ Complete Reference**: See `docs/cli-commands.md`

When helping users with natural language requests, reference the CLI command mappings:
- "Find prospects" ‚Üí `signalhire search` with Boolean operators  
- "Merge contacts" ‚Üí `signalhire dedupe merge` commands
- "Check limits" ‚Üí `signalhire status --credits` (shows 5000/day quotas)
- "Filter contacts" ‚Üí `signalhire filter job-title` commands
- "Analyze data" ‚Üí `signalhire analyze` commands (job-titles, geography, overlap)

### Updated Commands (v0.2.1+):
```bash
# Search with automatic 5000/day limit tracking
signalhire search --title "Software Engineer" --location "San Francisco" --size 50

# Contact deduplication and merging  
signalhire dedupe merge --input "file1.json,file2.json" --output merged.json

# Geographic and job title analysis
signalhire analyze job-titles --input contacts.json
signalhire analyze geography --input contacts.json

# Contact filtering
signalhire filter job-title --input contacts.json --output filtered.json --exclude-job-titles "operator,driver"

# Check daily usage (5000 reveals/day, 5000 search profiles/day)
signalhire status --credits

# Production deployment
./scripts/build/build-production.sh ~/target/directory --latest --force
```

### Production Deployment System
For production builds and deployments:
- **Build script**: `./scripts/build/build-production.sh` creates clean production packages
- **Auto-environment**: Copies development .env credentials to production .env
- **Virtual environments**: Automatic setup with `install.sh` script
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated releases on version tags (`git tag v0.2.1 && git push origin v0.2.1`)
- **Clean deployment**: Excludes development files (tests, specs, etc.)

## Development Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use async/await patterns, structured logging with JSON
- **TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier for Stagehand automation scripts
- **Testing**: TDD approach with contract, integration, and unit tests
- **Browser Automation**: Use Stagehand's AI-driven actions for reliability
- **Dependency Management**: Use `sudo` commands when installing packages on Linux systems - prompt user for password input in terminal when needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Always update task checkboxes in `/specs/001-looking-to-build/tasks.md` immediately after completing each task

## AI Agent Coordination
- **Multi-Agent Team**: GitHub Copilot (me), Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini
- **Spec-Kit Integration**: Work within `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` methodology from GitHub spec-kit framework
- **My Role**: Code generation, single-file implementations, CLI commands, service layer functions
- **Task Assignment**: Handle all tasks unless specifically assigned to @claude, @codex, or @gemini
- **Coordination**: Check for @mentions in tasks before proceeding with implementation
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Auto-assign based on task keywords, file patterns, and content type rather than fixed task IDs

## Important Notes  
- **API-First Approach**: Use API-based contact reveal for reliability (5000 contacts/day limit)
- **Search Profile Tracking**: Automatic 5000 search profiles/day limit monitoring  
- **Browser Automation**: Optional capability for bulk operations (1000+ contacts) when needed
- **Hybrid Strategy**: API for daily operations, browser automation for high-volume scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect 5000/day limits with built-in tracking and warnings (50%, 75%, 90%)
- Environment variables: SIGNALHIRE_EMAIL, SIGNALHIRE_PASSWORD
- **Dependency Installation**: Automatically handle missing dependencies with `run.py` script - will use sudo when needed and prompt for password
- **Task Management & Completion Protocol**: 
  - ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY commit code changes after EACH INDIVIDUAL TASK** - Do not batch multiple tasks
  - ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY mark tasks as complete** with `[x]` symbol in tasks.md after finishing each task
  - ‚úÖ **Use completion symbols** to show you have committed your work after each task
  - ‚úÖ **COMMIT CONTINUOUSLY** - After completing T007, commit immediately before starting T008
  - ‚ùå **NEVER leave uncommitted work** when marking tasks complete
  - ‚ùå **NEVER batch multiple task completions** before committing

## Recent Features
- 004-enterprise-contact-deduplication: Complete contact deduplication system with file merging and filtering
- Production build system with automated GitHub Actions workflow for clean deployments
- Robust environment management with virtual environment support and auto-configuration
- Enhanced AI agent integration with comprehensive CLI command references

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->

## WSL Environment Notes
- When reading screenshots or working with Windows paths, always use WSL-compatible paths (e.g., `/mnt/c/` instead of `C:\`)
- Screenshots saved by Windows applications should be accessed via WSL path format

- Always use absolute paths when reading files

## Code Quality Commands
- **ALWAYS** run linting and type checking commands after making code changes
- Lint code: `ruff check src/`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check --fix src/`  
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Use python3 run.py instead of direct pytest commands for consistent environment setup
- Test message for consistent behavior
- Always validate input parameters in all functions
- Never commit secrets or API keys - always use environment variables and .env files
- You're absolutely right - the environment variable issue is frustrating! The problem is that we're running Python from Windows but the .env file is in the WSL filesystem, so the environment variables aren't being loaded properly. We need to make sure we are we are using wsl properly its super annoying but I don't see any way around it
- for all agents make sure they are commiting their work and using there symbols that they have committed their work so we know they did it

# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## üéØ COPILOT: YOU ARE THE TASK ASSIGNER

**@copilot - Your Primary Role**: You are responsible for creating and assigning tasks to other agents via **GitHub SpecKit** integration.

### Your Responsibilities as Task Assigner:
1. **Read agent responsibilities**: Load and understand [agent-responsibilities.yaml](agent-responsibilities.yaml) 
2. **Study agent capabilities**: Review each agent's `.claude/agents/` files before assigning tasks:
   - `backend-tester.md` - Understands multiagent CLI testing integration
   - `production-specialist.md` - Handles multiagent devops CLI deployment  
   - `system-architect.md` - Multi-agent architecture design
   - `pr-feedback-router.md` - Routes PR feedback between agents
3. **Create SpecKit specifications**: Generate `/specs/[spec-name].md` files using GitHub SpecKit
4. **Assign tasks strategically**: Create `tasks.md` files with proper agent assignments:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] T010 @claude Design authentication system architecture
   - [ ] T025 @qwen Optimize database query performance  
   - [ ] T040 @codex Implement responsive user dashboard
   - [ ] T055 @gemini Document API endpoints and usage
   ```
5. **Follow agent specializations**: Assign tasks based on agent strengths (see agent-responsibilities.yaml)
6. **Consider SpecKit + SDK workflow**: Tasks should support the complete SpecKit ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí SDK feedback loop

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating any task assignments, you MUST:
- ‚úÖ Read [agent-responsibilities.yaml](agent-responsibilities.yaml) to understand each agent's role
- ‚úÖ Review the enhanced `.claude/agents/` files to understand their new capabilities:
  - These files now support **SpecKit integration** - can process `/specs/` directory
  - Enhanced with **multiagent CLI integration** - use real testing/devops/agentswarm commands
  - Support **Claude Code SDK patterns** - automatic and explicit invocation
  - Include **multi-agent workflow awareness** - understand @qwen, @gemini, @codex, @copilot coordination
- ‚úÖ Ensure tasks align with the SpecKit + multiagent CLI + SDK integration workflow
- ‚úÖ Load agent context before generating specs: Read relevant agent .md files to understand capabilities

## üîÑ DUAL ROLE: Task Assigner + Task Executor

**You have TWO responsibilities:**

### 1. Task Assignment (Your Primary Role)
- Create SpecKit specifications in `/specs/` directory
- Generate `tasks.md` files with strategic agent assignments
- Study agent capabilities before assigning work
- Coordinate the overall development workflow

### 2. Task Execution (Same as Other Agents) 
**You MUST follow the same 6-phase workflow as other agents:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Setup & Context Reading
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Worktree Setup & Environment Preparation  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Task Discovery & Planning (`grep "@copilot" specs/*/tasks.md`)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Implementation & Development Work
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: PR Creation & AgentSwarm Integration
- ‚úÖ **Phase 6**: Post-Merge Cleanup

**Work in isolated worktrees like all other agents:**
```bash
git worktree add -b agent-copilot-feature ../project-copilot main
cd ../project-copilot
# Implement your assigned @copilot tasks here
```

### SpecKit + Agent Integration Workflow:
1. **@copilot creates SpecKit specs** ‚Üí `/specs/[feature].md` files  
2. **@copilot generates task assignments** ‚Üí `tasks.md` with agent-specific assignments
3. **Agents read their tasks** ‚Üí Implement in isolated worktrees
4. **Agents create PRs** ‚Üí Trigger GitHub workflows  
5. **Claude Code SDK processes reviews** ‚Üí Enhanced .claude/agents/ handle feedback routing
6. **Feedback loops back to agents** ‚Üí Via GitHub CLI and multiagent CLI integration

### Agent Coordination in Solo Developer System

#### @copilot Role (Fast Implementation)
- **Scope**: All complexity levels with speed focus
- **Speed**: Fastest agent for development work
- **Collaboration**: Work with specialists for optimal results

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
### Implementation Phase (copilot's strength)
- [ ] T010 @copilot Build user authentication system
- [ ] T011 @copilot Create payment processing API
- [ ] T012 @copilot Implement notification service

### Specialist Enhancement Phase
- [ ] T020 @codex Create frontend UI (depends on T010-T012)
- [ ] T021 @qwen Optimize performance (depends on T020)
- [ ] T022 @gemini Document system (depends on T021)
```

- Security and compliance guidance
- Strategic technical direction

**Never handle:**
- Frontend work (that's @codex's exclusive domain)
- Performance optimization (collaborate with @qwen)
- Documentation (collaborate with @gemini)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Task Formatting Rules

#### ALWAYS Use Checkboxes for Sub-Tasks!

**‚úÖ CORRECT FORMAT - With checkboxes for tracking:**
```markdown
- [x] T019 @copilot Implement mode detection service ‚úÖ
  - [x] Create ModeDetector class for isolation mode
  - [x] Implement spec-kit vs local-first detection
  - [x] Add configuration-based mode overrides
```

**‚ùå WRONG FORMAT - No bullets without checkboxes:**
```markdown
- [x] T019 @copilot Implement mode detection service ‚úÖ
  - Create ModeDetector class  ‚ùå NO CHECKBOX!
  - Implement detection logic   ‚ùå NO CHECKBOX!
```

#### When Assigning Tasks to Other Agents

**ALWAYS include checkboxes AND specify dependencies:**

```markdown
## Sequential Tasks (Must be done in order)
- [ ] T001 @copilot Implement authentication backend
  - [ ] Create user model
  - [ ] Build JWT service
  - [ ] Add login endpoint
  - [ ] Add registration endpoint

- [ ] T002 @codex Create login UI (depends on T001)
  - [ ] Design login form
  - [ ] Add form validation
  - [ ] Connect to backend API
  - [ ] Handle auth responses

- [ ] T003 @qwen Optimize auth performance (depends on T001, T002)
  - [ ] Profile login performance
  - [ ] Add caching layer
  - [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Reduce token size

## Parallel Tasks (Can be done simultaneously)
- [ ] T010 @codex Build dashboard layout (PARALLEL)
  - [ ] Create navigation component
  - [ ] Design sidebar
  - [ ] Implement responsive grid

- [ ] T011 @gemini Write user documentation (PARALLEL)
  - [ ] Create getting started guide
  - [ ] Document API endpoints
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section

- [ ] T012 @qwen Optimize database indexes (PARALLEL)
  - [ ] Analyze query patterns
  - [ ] Add missing indexes
  - [ ] Test performance gains
```

#### Task Dependency Format

**ALWAYS specify dependencies clearly:**
```markdown
# Clear dependency specification
- [ ] T020 @codex Create payment form (depends on T015)
- [ ] T021 @qwen Optimize payment processing (depends on T020)
- [ ] T022 @gemini Document payment flow (depends on T020, T021)

# Parallel work indication
- [ ] T030 @codex Build header component (PARALLEL)
- [ ] T031 @codex Build footer component (PARALLEL) 
- [ ] T032 @codex Build sidebar component (PARALLEL)

# Mixed dependencies
- [ ] T040 @copilot Create API endpoints
- [ ] T041 @codex Build UI (depends on T040)
- [ ] T042 @qwen Add caching (depends on T040, PARALLEL with T041)
- [ ] T043 @gemini Write docs (PARALLEL with T041, T042)
```

### üîó Dependency Analysis Rules

#### When Creating Task Assignments:

1. **Identify Dependencies**
   - Backend must be done before frontend can connect
   - Data models before API endpoints
   - API endpoints before UI integration
   - Core functionality before optimization
   - Implementation before documentation

2. **Mark Parallel Opportunities**
   - Independent UI components can be built in parallel
   - Documentation can happen alongside development
   - Different microservices can be developed simultaneously
   - Optimization can happen parallel to new features
   - Testing can run parallel to documentation

3. **Use Clear Markers**
   - `(depends on T###)` - Sequential dependency
   - `(PARALLEL)` - Can be done simultaneously
   - `(PARALLEL with T###)` - Parallel to specific task
   - `(blocks T###)` - This task blocks another

#### Example Dependency Chain:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Backend Foundation
- [ ] T001 @copilot Create database models
- [ ] T002 @copilot Build core API (depends on T001)

## Phase 2: Parallel Development
- [ ] T010 @codex Create UI components (depends on T002, PARALLEL)
- [ ] T011 @qwen Optimize queries (depends on T002, PARALLEL)
- [ ] T012 @gemini Write API docs (depends on T002, PARALLEL)

## Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] T020 @codex Connect UI to API (depends on T010)
- [ ] T021 @claude Review integration (depends on T020, T011)
```

#### Professional Dependency Summary Format:
```markdown
## Task Dependencies Summary
- **Setup** (T001-T003): Must complete before all other tasks
- **Contract Tests** (T004-T010): Can run in parallel, complete before implementation
- **Data Models** (T011-T015): Can run in parallel, foundation for services
- **Services** (T016-T020): Sequential within service, parallel across services
- **CLI** (T021-T025): Depends on services, parallel within CLI
- **Integration** (T026-T030): Depends on services and CLI
- **Performance** (T031-T035): Depends on working implementation
- **Testing** (T036-T040): Depends on implementation, parallel with performance
- **Documentation** (T041-T045): Depends on all implementation complete
```

**ALWAYS include a dependency summary like this when assigning multiple tasks!**
