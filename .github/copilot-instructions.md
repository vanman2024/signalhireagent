# GitHub Copilot Instructions for signalhireagent

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-09-11

## Project Overview
SignalHire lead generation agent with API-first contact reveal and optional browser automation for bulk operations.

## Active Technologies
- Python 3.11 + asyncio (signalhireagent)
- Stagehand (AI browser automation with Playwright - optional)
- FastAPI (callback server for webhooks/status)
- httpx (async HTTP client for API operations)
- pandas (CSV data processing and export)
- pydantic (data validation and models)
## Architecture

## CLI Commands for AI Assistance

**üìñ Complete Reference**: See `docs/cli-commands.md`

When helping users with natural language requests, reference the CLI command mappings:
- "Find prospects" ‚Üí `signalhire search` with Boolean operators  
- "Merge contacts" ‚Üí `signalhire dedupe merge` commands
- "Check limits" ‚Üí `signalhire status --credits` (shows 5000/day quotas)
- "Filter contacts" ‚Üí `signalhire filter job-title` commands
- "Analyze data" ‚Üí `signalhire analyze` commands (job-titles, geography, overlap)

### Updated Commands (v0.2.1+):
```bash
# Search with automatic 5000/day limit tracking
signalhire search --title "Software Engineer" --location "San Francisco" --size 50

# Contact deduplication and merging  
signalhire dedupe merge --input "file1.json,file2.json" --output merged.json

# Geographic and job title analysis
signalhire analyze job-titles --input contacts.json
signalhire analyze geography --input contacts.json

# Contact filtering
signalhire filter job-title --input contacts.json --output filtered.json --exclude-job-titles "operator,driver"

# Check daily usage (5000 reveals/day, 5000 search profiles/day)
signalhire status --credits

# Production deployment
./scripts/build/build-production.sh ~/target/directory --latest --force
```

### Production Deployment System
For production builds and deployments:
- **Build script**: `./scripts/build/build-production.sh` creates clean production packages
- **Auto-environment**: Copies development .env credentials to production .env
- **Virtual environments**: Automatic setup with `install.sh` script
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated releases on version tags (`git tag v0.2.1 && git push origin v0.2.1`)
- **Clean deployment**: Excludes development files (tests, specs, etc.)

## Development Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use async/await patterns, structured logging with JSON
- **TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier for Stagehand automation scripts
- **Testing**: TDD approach with contract, integration, and unit tests
- **Browser Automation**: Use Stagehand's AI-driven actions for reliability
- **Dependency Management**: Use `sudo` commands when installing packages on Linux systems - prompt user for password input in terminal when needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Always update task checkboxes in `/specs/001-looking-to-build/tasks.md` immediately after completing each task

## AI Agent Coordination
- **Multi-Agent Team**: GitHub Copilot (me), Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini
- **Spec-Kit Integration**: Work within `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` methodology from GitHub spec-kit framework
- **My Role**: Code generation, single-file implementations, CLI commands, service layer functions
- **Task Assignment**: Handle all tasks unless specifically assigned to @claude, @codex, or @gemini
- **Coordination**: Check for @mentions in tasks before proceeding with implementation
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Auto-assign based on task keywords, file patterns, and content type rather than fixed task IDs

## Important Notes  
- **API-First Approach**: Use API-based contact reveal for reliability (5000 contacts/day limit)
- **Search Profile Tracking**: Automatic 5000 search profiles/day limit monitoring  
- **Browser Automation**: Optional capability for bulk operations (1000+ contacts) when needed
- **Hybrid Strategy**: API for daily operations, browser automation for high-volume scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect 5000/day limits with built-in tracking and warnings (50%, 75%, 90%)
- Environment variables: SIGNALHIRE_EMAIL, SIGNALHIRE_PASSWORD
- **Dependency Installation**: Automatically handle missing dependencies with `run.py` script - will use sudo when needed and prompt for password
- **Task Management & Completion Protocol**: 
  - ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY commit code changes after EACH INDIVIDUAL TASK** - Do not batch multiple tasks
  - ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATELY mark tasks as complete** with `[x]` symbol in tasks.md after finishing each task
  - ‚úÖ **Use completion symbols** to show you have committed your work after each task
  - ‚úÖ **COMMIT CONTINUOUSLY** - After completing T007, commit immediately before starting T008
  - ‚ùå **NEVER leave uncommitted work** when marking tasks complete
  - ‚ùå **NEVER batch multiple task completions** before committing

## Recent Features
- 004-enterprise-contact-deduplication: Complete contact deduplication system with file merging and filtering
- Production build system with automated GitHub Actions workflow for clean deployments
- Robust environment management with virtual environment support and auto-configuration
- Enhanced AI agent integration with comprehensive CLI command references

## WSL Environment Notes
- When reading screenshots or working with Windows paths, always use WSL-compatible paths (e.g., `/mnt/c/` instead of `C:\`)
- Screenshots saved by Windows applications should be accessed via WSL path format

- Always use absolute paths when reading files

## Code Quality Commands
- **ALWAYS** run linting and type checking commands after making code changes
- Lint code: `ruff check src/`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check --fix src/`  
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Use python3 run.py instead of direct pytest commands for consistent environment setup
- Test message for consistent behavior
- Always validate input parameters in all functions
- Never commit secrets or API keys - always use environment variables and .env files
- You're absolutely right - the environment variable issue is frustrating! The problem is that we're running Python from Windows but the .env file is in the WSL filesystem, so the environment variables aren't being loaded properly. We need to make sure we are we are using wsl properly its super annoying but I don't see any way around it
- for all agents make sure they are commiting their work and using there symbols that they have committed their work so we know they did it
