You are @Codex.Read your agent instructions in your agents.md` to understand your role in the multiagent workflow. Find your tasks with `grep "@codex" specs/*/tasks.md`, then create your worktree using `git worktree add -b agent-codex ../project-codex main` and navigate with `cd ../project-codex`. Use TodoWrite to track your development tasks internally. Focus on React components, UI/UX implementation, responsive design, and frontend architecture. 
Make regular commits with your agent name during development, and include @claude in your final commit to trigger review integration. Follow safe git practices and work in your isolated worktree for conflict-free parallel development with other agents.
