# The Solo Founder's Guide to AI-Powered Development

This is the definitive guide for solo founders who want to build applications with AI agents as development partners. The Multi-Agent Development Suite works with any agentic CLI (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, GitHub Copilot) and integrates seamlessly with existing projects.

## The Core Workflow: Spec -> Install -> Coordinate

The modern development process is built around a clean, three-phase workflow:

1.  **SPEC**: Use `spec-kit` to define *what* you want to build. This is the planning phase where you outline your application's features and requirements.
2.  **INSTALL**: Use pip packages to add only the capabilities you need. No forced dependencies, no vendor lock-in.
3.  **COORDINATE**: Your chosen AI CLI (Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Copilot) coordinates with the installed components to build, test, and deploy your application.

## Phase 1: Project Setup (5 Minutes)

### **Option A: New Project**
```bash
# Install core framework
pip install multiagent-core

# Initialize clean project structure
multiagent init my-new-app
cd my-new-app

# Add components as needed
pip install multiagent-devops            # DevOps automation
pip install multiagent-agentswarm        # Agent orchestration  
pip install multiagent-testing           # Testing framework
```

### **Option B: Existing Project (Most Common)**
```bash
# Go to your existing project
cd your-existing-project

# Add framework structure (won't overwrite existing files)
pip install multiagent-core
multiagent init

# Add specific capabilities
pip install multiagent-devops     # Instant DevOps automation
ops qa                           # Quality checks right away
```

### **Option C: Spec-Kit Integration**
```bash
# If you're using GitHub's spec-kit
specify init my-project
cd my-project

# Add multi-agent capabilities
pip install multiagent-core
multiagent init                  # Now you have both specs AND AI coordination
```

### **Prerequisites**
*   **Python 3.9+**: For the pip packages
*   **Git**: For version control
*   **Your preferred AI CLI**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, or GitHub Copilot

## Phase 2: AI CLI Integration (5 Minutes)

Choose your AI CLI and start building with agent assistance.

### **Claude Code**: Complex Features
```bash
# Claude Code excels at orchestrating complex, multi-step features
claude /create-issue "Add user authentication with email/password"
claude /work #123  # Automatically creates branch and PR

# Claude subagents handle specialized tasks:
# @claude/backend-tester: API testing
# @claude/frontend-playwright-tester: UI testing  
# @claude/security-auth-compliance: Authentication security
```

### **Gemini CLI**: Deep Analysis
```bash
# Gemini's 2M context window is perfect for understanding large codebases
gemini analyze "How should we structure the authentication system?"
gemini document "Generate comprehensive API documentation"

# Works great with ops CLI:
ops qa --backend && gemini review "Check test coverage and quality"
```

### **Qwen CLI**: Fast Development
```bash
# Qwen is ideal for rapid local development and testing
qwen implement "Create login form component"
qwen test "Run component tests locally"

# Quick iteration cycle:
ops qa --frontend && qwen optimize "Improve component performance"
```

### **GitHub Copilot**: Simple Tasks
```bash
# Copilot handles straightforward GitHub integration
# Simply use @copilot in GitHub comments:
# "@copilot implement basic user registration endpoint"
# "@copilot add unit tests for the login function"

# Integrates with ops CLI:
ops qa && gh pr create  # Copilot can suggest PR content
```

## Phase 3: Parallel Development with the Agent Swarm (30-60 Minutes)

This is where you unleash your AI development team.

### Step 7: Deploy the Agent Swarm
From your project root, run the `swarm` command. It will automatically find your `tasks.md` file, read the assignments, and deploy the correct agents with their specific instructions.

```bash
# The 'swarm' command is a wrapper for the script in your scripts directory
swarm "Implement the user authentication feature as defined in tasks.md"
```

### Step 8: Monitor Progress
You can watch your AI team work in real-time by monitoring their log files.

```bash
# View the combined log of all agents
tail -f /tmp/agent-swarm-logs/*.log
```

---

## Phase 4: Integration and Quality Assurance (15-30 Minutes)

Once the agents have completed their individual tasks, you will act as the lead integrator.

### Step 9: Coordinate and Integrate the Work
Use your primary agent, `@claude`, to review the code produced by the other agents, merge it, and resolve any conflicts.

```bash
# Use your interactive Claude session for this
claude /work "Review and integrate the completed authentication feature."
```

### Step 10: Run Quality Assurance
Use the built-in DevOps CLI to run a comprehensive suite of quality checks.

```bash
# From your project root
./devops/ops/ops qa
```

### Step 11: Commit and Repeat
Commit the finished, tested feature to your repository. You are now ready to loop back to **Phase 2** to begin planning the next feature.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system via agent swarm"
git push
```

This iterative cycle of **Spec -> Install -> Coordinate** allows you to build complex applications at an accelerated pace, with a team of specialized AI agents handling the heavy lifting.
