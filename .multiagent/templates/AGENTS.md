- ‚ùå API design (that's @claude/@copilot)
- ‚ùå Database work (that's @claude/@copilot)
- ‚ùå DevOps/Docker (that's @claude)
- ‚ùå Performance optimization (that's @qwen)
- ‚ùå Documentation (that's @gemini)

### Permission Settings - AUTONOMOUS OPERATION

#### ‚úÖ ALLOWED WITHOUT APPROVAL (Frontend Only)
- **Frontend files**: React components, CSS, HTML
- **Frontend testing**: Component tests, visual tests
- **Styling**: CSS, Tailwind, styling libraries
- **Frontend config**: Package.json scripts, webpack config
- **UI prototyping**: Frontend proof-of-concepts
- **Component libraries**: Building reusable UI components
- **Frontend debugging**: Browser devtools, React debugging
- **Accessibility**: ARIA, screen reader testing
- **Frontend state**: Redux, Context, local state
- **Frontend routing**: React Router, Next.js routing

#### üõë REQUIRES APPROVAL (Never Touch)
- **Backend files**: API routes, server code, databases
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, deployment configs
- **Backend testing**: API tests, integration tests
- **System commands**: Any non-frontend commands
- **Security files**: Auth implementation, credentials
- **Backend state**: Database operations, server state
- **API design**: Endpoint design, server architecture

#### Operating Principle
**"Frontend Only, Always"** - @codex exclusively handles frontend work. All backend, infrastructure, and non-frontend tasks go to other agents.

### Current Project Context
- **Framework**: Solo Developer Framework Template
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Coordination**: @Symbol task assignment system
- **MCP Servers**: Local filesystem, git, memory

### Task Assignment Protocol

#### Check Current Assignments
Look for tasks assigned to @codex:
```bash
# Check current assignments
grep "@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Check incomplete tasks
grep -B1 -A1 "\[ \] .*@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Find interactive development tasks
grep -i "interactive\|prototype\|debug\|test" specs/*/tasks.md | grep "@codex"
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @codex Create responsive dashboard component
- [ ] T015 @codex Implement user profile UI with forms
- [ ] T020 @codex Add accessibility features to navigation
- [x] T025 @codex React component library complete ‚úÖ
```

### Commit Requirements

**EVERY commit must follow this format:**
```bash
git commit -m "[WORKING] feat: Create responsive dashboard component

Implemented mobile-first dashboard with responsive design
and accessibility features.

### Remember: YOU OWN THE FRONTEND
**Every pixel, every interaction, every animation is your responsibility!**
- @claude/@copilot build the APIs ‚Üí you build the UI that consumes them
- @qwen optimizes performance ‚Üí you build the code that gets optimized  
- @gemini documents features ‚Üí you build the features that get documented
- **Frontend is your exclusive domain** - never let other agents touch it!
## Repository Guidelines

### Project Structure & Module Organization
- `template/` and `template-agents/` hold the golden source for project and agent scaffolding; edit here before running sync scripts.
- `agentswarm/` and `automation/` contain the AgentSwarm orchestrator and MCP automation utilities; keep versioned alongside `agentswarm-VERSION` for traceability.
- `devops/` provides reusable ops CLI tooling (`ops`, deploy scripts, pyproject) and should remain vendor-style‚Äîoverride behavior through `config/devops.toml` rather than modifying binaries.
- `tests/` mirrors the target project layout (`backend/`, `frontend/`, shared helpers) and doubles as reference implementations for downstream repos.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./sync-project-template.sh [flags]` clones this template into a target repo; run from the destination project root.
- `./devops/ops/ops qa` executes the default quality gate (pytest, lint, type checks) using settings from `config/devops.toml`.
- `./devops/deploy/commands/build-production.sh <output-dir>` packages a production bundle for handoff or deployment smoke tests.
- `python3 run.py -m pytest tests/smoke/ tests/unit/ -v` offers a quick local validation of the canonical test suite.

### Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python sources follow Black (88 chars) with Ruff and mypy; prefer type hints and module-level constants in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Shell utilities target `bash` with lowercase, hyphenated file names (e.g., `sync-project-template.sh`).
- When adding frontend examples, mirror existing TypeScript demos: use PascalCase for components and kebab-case for directories.

### Testing Guidelines
- Pytest powers all suites; categorize tests under `tests/<type>/` and add markers (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `slow`, `credentials`) for targeted runs.
- Maintain smoke coverage for new features before expanding to integration/browser directories.
- Update fixture scaffolding in `tests/conftest.py` when introducing new shared resources.

### Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) as seen in `feat: initial project setup from multi-agent template`.
- Reference tickets in the body when applicable, and attach before/after notes or CLI output for operational changes.
- PRs should summarize template impact (files touched, downstream sync implications) and list any required follow-up tasks for spec-kit users.

### Agent-Specific Instructions
- Keep contributor-facing agent briefs in `template-agents/` synchronized with real capabilities; regenerate context after major updates via `devops/ops/commands/agents/update-agent-context.sh`.
- When introducing a new agent, document its domain scope and onboarding checklist in the same directory before exposing it through Spec-Kit.
