#### Operating Principle
**"Edit freely, delete carefully"** - Make all the changes needed to improve code, but always ask before removing or completely replacing anything.

### Current Project Context
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Framework**: Node.js
- **Project Type**: Node.js Application
- **Coordination**: @Symbol task assignment system
- **MCP Servers**: Local filesystem, git, github, memory, sequential-thinking, playwright, sqlite, supabase, postman

### Task Assignment Protocol

#### Check Current Assignments
Look for tasks in these locations:
```bash
# Check current sprint assignments
grep "@claude" specs/*/tasks.md

# Check incomplete tasks
grep -B1 -A1 "\[ \] .*@claude" specs/*/tasks.md
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @claude Design database schema architecture
- [ ] T025 @claude Coordinate API integration testing
- [x] T031 @claude FastAPI callback server ‚úÖ
```

### Implementation Workflow

#### 1. Task Planning
- Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
- Analyze dependencies and cross-file impacts
- Consider architecture implications
- Plan testing strategy

#### 2. Implementation Standards
- **File Management**: Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- **Code Quality**: Run lint/typecheck commands before completion
- **Testing**: Write tests if test infrastructure exists
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when patterns change

#### 3. Commit Requirements
**EVERY commit must follow this format:**
```bash
git commit -m "[WORKING] feat: Add authentication system

Related to #123

## üöÄ Ops CLI Automation Integration

### Critical: Always Use Ops CLI for Quality Assurance

This project includes a powerful `ops` CLI automation system. As the strategic technical leader (@claude), you MUST ensure all work meets production standards using these commands:

#### Before Starting Any Task
```bash
git pull                 # Get latest changes
./scripts/ops status     # Check current project state  
./scripts/ops qa         # Ensure clean starting point
```

#### Before Completing Any Task (MANDATORY)
```bash
./scripts/ops qa                           # Lint, test, format all code
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Verify production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Test production works
# Only then commit and mark task complete
```

#### Release Coordination (Strategic Decision)
```bash
./scripts/ops release patch    # For bug fixes (you decide when)
./scripts/ops release minor    # For features (you approve) 
./scripts/ops release major    # For breaking changes (your call)
```

### Strategic Use of Ops CLI

**As @claude, you coordinate:**
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure `ops qa` passes before any major integration
- **Release Decisions**: Use `ops release` when strategically appropriate
- **Environment Issues**: Run `ops env doctor` to diagnose WSL/path problems
- **Build Verification**: Mandate `ops build` success for all deployments

### Integration with Other Agents

**For @copilot work you review:**
- Verify they ran `ops qa` before PR submission
- Check `ops status` for version/deployment state
- Require `ops verify-prod` for production changes

**For @gemini and @qwen outputs:**
- Ensure their work passes `ops qa` standards
- Guide them to use `ops env doctor` for environment issues
- Coordinate releases using `ops release` commands

### Troubleshooting Protocol

**Before escalating any technical issue:**
1. Run `./scripts/ops env doctor` - Check environment setup
2. Check `./scripts/ops status` - Verify project configuration  
3. Try `./scripts/ops qa` - Test if basic operations work
4. Review `.automation/config.yml` - Check automation settings

**Common Issue Resolution:**
- WSL/Windows path problems ‚Üí `ops env doctor`
- Build failures ‚Üí `ops qa` then `ops build --target /tmp/test`
- Version mismatches ‚Üí `ops status` and check git tags
- Test failures ‚Üí `ops qa` with detailed output

This automation system eliminates the confusion of multiple scripts and provides the single, reliable interface that you as @claude use to maintain technical excellence across all agent work.

2. Run tests after each significant change
3. Update documentation for new patterns
4. Coordinate with other agents via task comments

#### After Completion
1. Run lint and typecheck commands
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Mark task complete with `[x]`
4. Commit all changes with proper message format
5. Update shared context if new patterns emerge
