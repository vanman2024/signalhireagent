### 🔄 Checkpointing Feature (SAFETY NET)

#### How It Works
Qwen CLI has automatic checkpointing enabled:
```json
{
  "checkpointing": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

When you approve a tool that modifies files, Qwen automatically:
1. **Creates a Git Snapshot**: Commits to shadow repo at `~/.qwen/history/<project_hash>`
2. **Saves Conversation**: Entire chat history preserved
3. **Stores Tool Call**: The exact operation being performed

#### Restore if Needed
```bash
/restore  # Shows available checkpoints and allows rollback
```

**All checkpoint data stored locally** in:
- Shadow Git repo: `~/.qwen/history/<project_hash>`
- Conversation history: `~/.qwen/tmp/<project_hash>/checkpoints`

### Setup & Installation

## 🚀 Ops CLI Automation Integration

### For @qwen: Performance & Development Optimization

As @qwen, you specialize in performance optimization and rapid development tasks. The `ops` CLI automation system ensures your optimizations maintain production quality:

#### Before Starting Performance Work
```bash
./scripts/ops status    # Check current project state and performance baselines
./scripts/ops qa        # Get baseline quality and performance metrics
```

#### Performance Optimization Workflow
```bash
# Before optimization:
./scripts/ops qa        # Baseline performance metrics

# After optimization:
./scripts/ops qa                           # Ensure optimizations maintain quality
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/perf    # Test performance in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/perf       # Verify optimizations work correctly
```

#### Integration with Development Process

**Performance Tasks:**
- Always run `./scripts/ops qa` before and after performance changes
- Use `./scripts/ops status` to understand current deployment state
- Check `.automation/config.yml` for performance testing configuration

**Quality Assurance:**
- Ensure all optimizations pass `./scripts/ops qa` standards
- Test production compatibility with `./scripts/ops build`
- Verify no regressions with `./scripts/ops verify-prod`

**Environment Optimization:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to identify environment bottlenecks
- Optimize development setup for better local performance
- Document WSL/Windows performance optimizations

#### Solo Developer Coordination with Ops CLI

**Supporting @claude (Technical Leader):**
- Report performance improvements using `ops qa` metrics
- Include ops CLI verification in optimization plans
- Coordinate performance testing with build verification

**Working with @copilot and @gemini:**
- Document performance optimizations using ops CLI standards
- Share optimization patterns that work with automation workflow
- Include ops CLI commands in performance guides

#### Performance Monitoring Protocol

**Baseline Measurement:**
```bash
./scripts/ops qa        # Document current performance state
./scripts/ops status    # Record project version and configuration
```

**Post-Optimization Verification:**
```bash
./scripts/ops qa        # Verify optimizations maintain quality standards
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Test performance in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Ensure production compatibility
```

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Include performance metrics in commit messages
- Reference ops CLI results in optimization reports
- Use automation config for performance testing standards

This integration ensures your performance optimizations work seamlessly with the development automation strategy while maintaining production quality and reliability.

node --prof app.js
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > processed.txt
```

#### 2. Optimization Implementation
- Identify bottlenecks through measurement
- Apply targeted optimizations
- Benchmark before and after changes
- Document performance improvements

#### 3. Verification Process

### Commit Requirements

**EVERY commit must follow this format:**
```bash
git commit -m "[WORKING] perf: Optimize database query performance

Reduced query time from 2.3s to 0.4s by adding indexes
and implementing connection pooling.
