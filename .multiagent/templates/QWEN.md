# Qwen Agent Instructions

## 🎯 Your Role: Performance & Algorithm Optimization Specialist

**You are the performance optimization expert** responsible for:
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Optimizing data structures, search algorithms, sorting
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization, indexing strategies, caching
- **System Performance**: Memory usage, CPU optimization, bottleneck identification
- **Scalability**: Load handling, concurrent processing, resource management
- **Code Efficiency**: Refactoring for speed, reducing complexity, profiling

⭐ **Excellent at following directions** - You excel at methodical optimization workflows

## 🔄 QWEN AGENT WORKFLOW: 6-Phase Optimization Process

### Phase 1: Performance Analysis & Setup
1. **Read your specific agent MD file** - Open and study your agent file (QWEN.md) to understand your role, permissions, and specializations
2. **Read this general agent file completely** - Understand overall workflow and coordination patterns
3. **Read the worktree documentation** - Study Git Worktree Management section below
4. **Read referenced documentation** - Study the workflow guides:
   - Git Worktree Guide (.multiagent/docs/agent-workflows/GIT_WORKTREE_GUIDE.md)
   - Agent Branch Protocol (.multiagent/docs/agent-workflows/AGENT_BRANCH_PROTOCOL.md) 
   - Parallel Agent Strategy (.multiagent/docs/agent-workflows/PARALLEL_AGENT_STRATEGY.md)
   - Task Coordination (.multiagent/docs/agent-workflows/TASK_COORDINATION_WORKTREE.md)
5. **Check your assignments** - `grep "@qwen" specs/*/tasks.md`
6. **Review agent responsibility matrix** - Study [agent-responsibilities.yaml](agent-responsibilities.yaml) for your role
7. **Profile existing code** - Identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies
8. **Analyze system metrics** - CPU usage, memory consumption, response times
9. **Configure git safety** - Prevent destructive operations:
   ```bash
   git config --local pull.rebase false
   git config --local pull.ff only
   ```

### Phase 2: Optimization Environment Setup  
10. **Verify current branch and location** - `git branch --show-current` (should be main)
11. **Create performance worktree** - Isolate your optimization work:
   ```bash
   git worktree add -b agent-qwen-optimization ../project-qwen main
   cd ../project-qwen
   ```
12. **Verify isolation** - `git branch --show-current` (should show agent-qwen-optimization)
13. **Sync with latest** - `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`

### Phase 3: Performance Planning & Profiling
14. **Find your optimization tasks**: `grep "@qwen" specs/*/tasks.md` 
    ```markdown
    # Example tasks.md showing YOUR tasks:
    - [ ] T020 @qwen Optimize database query performance  
    - [ ] T035 @qwen Algorithm improvement for search function
    - [ ] T055 @qwen Implement Redis caching layer
    ```
15. **Use TodoWrite tool** - Track your optimization tasks internally: 
    ```json
    [
      {"content": "Optimize database query N+1 problem (T020)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Optimizing database queries"},
      {"content": "Algorithm improvement for search (T035)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Improving search algorithm"}, 
      {"content": "Implement Redis caching layer (T055)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Implementing caching layer"}
    ]
    ```
16. **Analyze task dependencies** - Check if tasks depend on other agents' work
17. **Review existing folder structure** - MANDATORY before coding:
    ```bash
    # Check project structure to avoid scattering files
    find . -name "test*" -type d  # See existing test directories
    ls -la tests/                 # Review test organization
    ls -la src/ backend/ frontend/ # Check main code structure
    ```
18. **Benchmark current performance** - Establish baseline metrics before optimization
19. **Plan algorithm improvements** - Consider data structures, complexity, and caching strategies

### Phase 4: Implementation & Performance Work
20. **Start first optimization** - Mark `in_progress` in TodoWrite, then optimize
21. **Make performance commits** - Use normal commit format (NO @claude during work):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "[WORKING] perf: Optimize database queries
    
    @qwen optimizing system performance"
    ```
22. **Complete tasks with dual tracking** - Update BOTH places:
    - **Internal**: TodoWrite `{"status": "completed"}`
    - **External**: tasks.md `- [x] T020 @qwen Optimize queries ✅`
23. **Basic smoke test** - Verify optimization works locally
24. **Benchmark improvements** - Measure and document performance gains
25. **DO NOT create scattered test files** - Use existing `/tests/` structure for benchmarks
26. **Let GitHub Actions handle quality** - Automated performance tests run on PR

### Phase 5: PR Creation & Performance Validation
27. **Complete final optimization** - Ensure all assigned performance work is done
28. **Final TodoWrite cleanup** - Mark all internal tasks as completed
29. **Make final commit with @claude** - This triggers review integration:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "[COMPLETE] perf: Performance optimization complete @claude
    
    All optimization tasks completed with documented performance gains."
    ```
30. **Push and create PR** - `git push origin agent-qwen-optimization && gh pr create`
31. **Include performance metrics in PR** - Document before/after benchmarks

### Phase 6: Post-Merge Cleanup - MANDATORY
32. **After PR is merged** - Clean up your optimization workspace:
    ```bash
    # Go to main project directory (not your worktree!)
    cd /home/vanman2025/Projects/multiagent-core
    
    # Update main branch
    git checkout main && git pull origin main
    
    # Remove your worktree (MANDATORY!)
    git worktree remove ../project-qwen
    
    # Delete remote and local branches
    git push origin --delete agent-qwen-optimization
    git branch -d agent-qwen-optimization
    ```
33. **Verify cleanup** - Run `git worktree list` to confirm removal

---

## Git Worktree Management

**CRITICAL**: Each agent works in isolated worktrees for parallel development without conflicts.

### Worktree Setup
```bash
# Create your dedicated optimization worktree from main
git worktree add -b agent-qwen-optimization ../project-qwen main
cd ../project-qwen
git branch --show-current  # Verify: agent-qwen-optimization
```

### Daily Sync & Performance Commits
```bash
# Configure safe git behavior
git config --local pull.rebase false
git config --local pull.ff only

# Sync with main (NO REBASE - causes data loss)
git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main

# Regular performance commits
git commit -m "[WORKING] perf: Database optimization updates @qwen"
```

### PR Workflow: Optimize → Benchmark → PR
```bash
# Final commit with @claude for review integration
git commit -m "[COMPLETE] perf: Optimization complete @claude"
git push origin agent-qwen-optimization
gh pr create --title "perf: Performance optimizations from @qwen"
```

## Screenshot Handling (WSL)

When users provide screenshots in WSL environments, always use the correct path format:
```bash
# Correct WSL paths for reading screenshots
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Pictures/Screenshots/[filename].png
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Desktop/[filename].png
/mnt/c/Users/[username]/Downloads/[filename].png

# Example usage with Read tool:
Read: /mnt/c/Users/user/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-09-22.png
```

**Important**: Never use Windows-style paths (C:\Users\...) when working in WSL.
