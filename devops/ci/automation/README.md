# Automated Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Future infrastructure for automated deployment building on current ops/deploy system.**

> **Status**: 🚧 **FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE** - Not yet implemented  
> **Current System**: Use `../../ops/` and `../../deploy/` for manual deployment workflow

## 🎯 **Purpose**

Automated CD system that **builds on top of** your current working ops/deploy commands:

- **Leverages Current System**: Uses existing `../../ops/ops` and `../../deploy/deploy` commands
- **Automated Triggers**: Deploy on successful tests, releases, or manual triggers
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging, production, testing environments
- **Safe Automation**: Maintains manual override capabilities

## 🔧 **Design Philosophy**

**Build On, Don't Replace**:
```bash
# Current manual workflow (keep working)
./devops/ops/ops qa
./devops/ops/ops build  
./devops/deploy/deploy production

# Future automated workflow (builds on above)
git push → GitHub Actions → calls same ops/deploy commands → automated deployment
```

## 🚀 **Future Implementation**

### **Automated Pipeline** (builds on current system)
```bash
# GitHub Actions calls your existing commands
- name: Quality Assurance
  run: ./devops/ops/ops qa

- name: Build Production  
  run: ./devops/ops/ops build --target ${{ env.DEPLOY_TARGET }}

- name: Verify Build
  run: ./devops/ops/ops verify-prod

- name: Deploy to Environment
  run: ./devops/deploy/deploy production ${{ env.DEPLOY_TARGET }}

- name: Create Release
  run: ./devops/ops/ops release patch
```

### **Environment Management**
```yaml
# config/environments.yml
environments:
  staging:
    target: ~/deploy/staging
    auto_deploy: true
    trigger: main_branch
    
  production:
    target: ~/deploy/production  
    auto_deploy: false  # Manual approval required
    trigger: release_tag
    
  testing:
    target: ~/deploy/testing
    auto_deploy: true
    trigger: pull_request
```

### **Deployment Pipeline Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy-pipeline.sh
# 
# Orchestrates existing ops/deploy commands for automation
# BUILDS ON TOP OF current working system

set -e

ENVIRONMENT=${1:-staging}
echo "🚀 Starting automated deployment to: $ENVIRONMENT"

# Use existing ops commands (don't reinvent)
echo "1️⃣ Quality Assurance..."
../../ops/ops qa

echo "2️⃣ Building production..."  
../../ops/ops build --target "$DEPLOY_TARGET"

echo "3️⃣ Verifying build..."
../../ops/ops verify-prod

echo "4️⃣ Deploying..."
../../deploy/deploy production "$DEPLOY_TARGET"

echo "5️⃣ Post-deployment verification..."
# Add environment-specific health checks

echo "✅ Automated deployment complete!"
```

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **With Current Ops System**
- **No Changes Required**: Existing `ops` commands work as-is
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Extend `../../ops/config.yml` with CD settings
- **Automated Triggers**: GitHub Actions calls existing `ops` workflow

### **With Current Deploy System**  
- **Leverage Build Scripts**: Use existing `../../deploy/commands/build-production.sh`
- **Environment Targets**: Extend current target system for multiple environments
- **Same Mechanics**: Keep file preservation, dependency management

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Risk-Free**: Current manual system keeps working
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Add automation piece by piece  
3. **Proven Foundation**: Build on tested ops/deploy commands
4. **Easy Rollback**: Can always fall back to manual workflow
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Automated and manual deployments work identically

## 📋 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1**: Basic Automation
- [ ] GitHub Actions that call existing ops/deploy commands
- [ ] Staging environment automated deployment
- [ ] Production deployment with manual approval

### **Phase 2**: Enhanced CD
- [ ] Multi-environment management
- [ ] Automated rollback capabilities  
- [ ] Deployment notifications and monitoring

### **Phase 3**: Advanced Features
- [ ] Blue/green deployments
- [ ] Canary releases
- [ ] Integration with monitoring systems

**🎯 Key Principle**: This automated CD system **enhances** your current ops/deploy workflow rather than replacing it. You maintain full manual control while gaining automation benefits.
