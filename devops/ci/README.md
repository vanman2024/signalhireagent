# Cross-Platform CI/CD System

**☁️ AUTOMATED infrastructure that will TRIGGER your LOCAL systems.**

> **Status**: 🚧 **FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE** - Not yet implemented  
> **Current System**: Use `../ops/` (LOCAL) and `../deploy/` (LOCAL) for active development workflow  
> **Future System**: This CI system will TRIGGER your LOCAL ops/deploy commands via GitHub Actions

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This directory contains **☁️ AUTOMATED infrastructure** that will **TRIGGER your 🖥️ LOCAL systems**:

## **Key Principle**: AUTOMATED Triggers LOCAL (Never Replaces)

- **Multi-OS Testing**: GitHub Actions will run your `../ops/ops qa` on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **GitHub Actions**: AUTOMATED workflows that call your LOCAL `../ops/` and `../deploy/` commands  
- **Platform-Specific Builds**: GitHub Actions will run your LOCAL `../deploy/deploy build` on multiple OS
- **Matrix Testing**: Test your LOCAL system across multiple environments simultaneously

**What This Means**:
- ✅ Your LOCAL `../ops/ops qa` keeps working exactly as it does now
- ✅ AUTOMATED system will run the SAME `../ops/ops qa` command on GitHub Actions
- ✅ No changes to your LOCAL workflow - automation just orchestrates it

## 📁 **Structure**

```

├── README.md              # This overview  
├── docs/                  # CI/CD documentation
├── workflows/             # GitHub Actions workflows

```

## 🚧 **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1**: Current Working System ✅
- `../ops/` - Local development workflow (qa, build, release)
- `../deploy/` - Single-platform production deployment
- Clean environment testing on current platform

### **Phase 2**: Cross-Platform Testing (This Directory)
- GitHub Actions matrix testing
- Multi-OS build validation  
- Platform-specific deployment packages
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## 🔧 **Future Components**

### **GitHub Actions Workflows** (`workflows/`)
```yaml
# Example: .github/workflows/cross-platform-test.yml
name: Cross-Platform Testing
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        node-version: [18, 20]
```

### **Platform-Specific Builds** (`platform-builds/`)
```bash
# Example scripts:
build-linux.sh      # Linux-specific build process
build-macos.sh       # macOS-specific build process  
build-windows.sh     # Windows-specific build process
build-docker.sh      # Containerized builds
```

### **Test Matrix Configurations** (`test-matrix/`)
```bash
# Example configurations:
matrix-backend.yml   # Backend service testing matrix
matrix-frontend.yml  # Frontend app testing matrix
matrix-cli.yml       # CLI tool testing matrix
```

## 📚 **Documentation** (`docs/`)
- Platform-specific setup guides
- CI/CD workflow documentation
- Cross-platform testing strategies
- Deployment target configurations

## 🔗 **Integration with Current System**

The CI system will **extend** the current ops/deploy system:

```bash
# Current workflow (Phase 1)
./devops/ops/ops qa          # Local QA
./devops/ops/ops build       # Local build
./devops/deploy/deploy production

# Future workflow (Phase 2) 
git push origin main         # Triggers CI workflows
# → GitHub Actions runs cross-platform tests
# → Multi-OS builds created automatically
# → Platform-specific deployments
```

## 🎨 **Design Principles**

1. **Non-Breaking**: Never interfere with current ops/deploy system
2. **Additive**: Extend functionality, don't replace
3. **Optional**: Current system works without CI
4. **Template-Ready**: Copy entire devops/ folder to new projects

## 🚀 **When to Implement**

Implement this CI system when you need:
- Multi-platform compatibility validation
- Automated testing across different OS environments  
- Platform-specific deployment packages
- Continuous integration for releases

## 💡 **Current Status**

**Working Now**: 
- `../ops/ops qa` - Quality assurance
- `../ops/ops build` - Production builds
- `../deploy/deploy production` - Deployment

**Future Addition**:
- Cross-platform GitHub Actions workflows
- Multi-OS testing and validation
- Platform-specific build artifacts

**⚠️ Note**: This directory contains **future infrastructure**. For current development, continue using the `../ops/` and `../deploy/` systems.
